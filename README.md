## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned how to use some features such as "position" and "display: flex".
One of the biggest difficulties was centering the image with text.
However, I managed to organize it and leave it in the most standard way possible.

### Continued development

By constantly studying the HTML and CSS languages, I see that I am making great progress in my knowledge. I believe there is still more to learn about WEB development.
I have seen that my perception of programming - although not yet in an actual programming language - has improved a lot, compared to my first projects.
My next advancement will be in the JavaScript programming language.
